There are some regions where women fight for and win freedom and opportunity to play their roles in a new content with new occupations and a new way of life . But still there are many places were women is chained and shackled to the social taboos and restrictions and lakshmanrekhas marked by others.our conference is to reach such women and erase the lakshmanrekhas that are stopping them . This conference can provide a light for the women surrounded in the darkness.
     Drop by drop makes an ocean . Our conference is that drop which would change to an ocean soon.

            <p class="lead">
            "You can tell the condition of a Nation by looking at the status of its Women." Jawaharlal Nehru, Leader of India's Independence movement, and India's first Prime Minister.
            Today's India offers a lot of opportunities to women, with women having a voice in everyday life, the business world as well as in political life. Nevertheless India is still a male dominated society, where women are often seen as subordinate and inferior to men.
            "Indian women on the rise" section now. And however, though India is moving away from the male dominated culture, discrimination is still highly visible in rural as well as in urban areas, throughout all state of society. While women are guaranteed equality under the constitution, legal protection has a limited effect, where patriarchal traditions prevail.
            Much of the discrimination against women arises from India's dowry tradition, where the bride's family gives the groom's family money and or gifts. Dowries were made illegal in India in 1961. And even this doesn’t make a big change. And the next is, The Indian constitution grants women equal rights to men, but strong patriarchal traditions persist in many different societal parts, with women's lives shaped by customs that are centuries old.

            <p class="lead">
            According India’s constitution, women are legal citizens of the country and have equal rights with men (Indian Parliament). Because of lack of acceptance from the male dominant society, Indian women suffer immensely. Women are responsible for baring children, yet they are malnourished and in poor health. Women are also overworked in the field and complete the all of the domestic work. Most Indian women are uneducated.  Although the country’s constitution says women have equal status to men, women are powerless and are mistreated inside and outside the home.
            Even though the constitution guarantees free primary schooling to everyone up to 14 years of age (Indian Parliament), very few females attend school. Only about 39 percent of all women in India actually attend primary schools. There are several reasons why families choose not to educate their daughters. One reason is that parents get nothing in return for educating their daughters. Another reason is that all the females in a household have the responsibility of the housework. So even though education does not financially burden the family, it costs them the time she spends at school when she could be doing chores. In addition, even if a woman is educated, especially in the poorer regions, there is no hope for a job. Most jobs women perform are agricultural or domestic which do not require a formal education. Another reason girls are not educated is because families are required to supply a chaste daughter to the family of her future husband. With over two-thirds of teachers in India being men and students predominately male, putting daughters in school, where males surround them all day could pose a possible threat to their virginity. When this comes to their work this happens, Even though women work twice as many hours as men, the men say that “women eat food and do nothing.” This is mainly because the work women perform does not require a lot of skill and are smaller tasks. These are sad status of women till now, even though the millions of years have changed.

            <p class="lead">
            Women status during British rule in India was not so changed even became worse. It was started changing after many years of struggle for India’s freedom when Mahatma Gandhi gave a call to women to come forward and take part in the independence movement. There is hand of many great women (Vijaya LaxmI Pandit, Sarojini Naidu, Mrs. Aruna Asaf Ali, etc.) who helped in changing the women status in India. After the occurrence of Mrs. Indira Gandhi as a Prime Minister of India, the condition of women was changed positively a lot. She became a worldwide famous woman and thus great icon and inspiration for other Indian women. Later the prestigious positions of many women in India have proved that women are not inferior to men and can go together.
            Nowadays as a result we have got freedom by  leaders who have fought for Women’s freedom , Indian woman have distinguished themselves in various spheres of life as politicians, orators, lawyers, doctors, administrators and diplomats. They are not only entrusted with work of responsibility but also they perform their duties very honestly and sincerely. There is hardly any sphere of life in which Indian women have not taken part and shown their worth. Women exercise their right to vote, contest for Parliament and Assembly, seek appointment in public office and compete in other spheres of life with men. This shows that women in India enjoy today more liberty and equality than before. They have acquired more liberty to participate in the affairs of the country. They have been given equality with men in shaping their future and sharing responsibilities for themselves, their family and their country.
            It is a fact that women are intelligent, hard-working and efficient in work. They put heart and soul together in whatever they undertake. As typists and clerks they are now competing successfully with men. There are many women working in the Central Secretariat. They are striving very hard to reach highest efficiency and perfection in the administrative work. Their integrity of character is probably better than men. Generally it was found that women are less susceptible to corruption in form of bribery and favoritism. They are not only sweet tongued but also honest, efficient and punctual in their jobs as receptionists, air-hostesses and booking clerks at railway reservation counters. As a matter of fact they are gradually monopolizing the jobs of receptionists and air-hostesses.

        <h1 style="font-family: 'Spicy Rice', cursive;"> Women empowerment conference - a start towards change....</h1>
        The women’s empowerment conference is the first of its kind and will help give perspective and awareness as well to women and men about women empowerment. As everyone might have heard about women empowerment once in a while but, might not have a better and bigger picture about it. Hearing about women empowerment and hearing for people who have actually worked towards it and also from the person at the receiving end of empowerment can give a real picture and insight about the real meaning of women empowerment and the struggles they have to make to achieve it. 
        The conference is taking place to bring about a change in the mindset of people and how they look at women and empowerment and the both the aspects together. Lately, there have been quite many women empowerment movements to work towards a better place for women. WERP India itself is an organization for women empowerment. The conference will help in building up a strong argument that why women empowerment should take place and why this is the high time that each person must pay their dues towards women empowerment. 
        There have been a lot of misconceptions, false perceptions, and unsolved questions, baseless arguments about women empowerment which can be solved in just one place with the help some experienced and experts in their fields and real life heroes whose stories everyone must know.   
        The conference is not going to be like a lecture it is more of an interacting session which would help people clear their doubts and after the conference ends and while they are returning they will not be going empty handed. They will have the knowledge, answers to their questions; will to change the social norms, work towards betterment and a confidence that they will not be alone for the change for the betterment as WERP India, and many other students, women and men will also be with them. 
        There will be a lot to learn from each other and their encounters with women empowerment and also how once can contribute towards women empowerment. As one can learn better with practical knowledge and a person who is experiences can share their and experience and give an elaborate description about the changes, and insightful information.
        To make the conference a little more interactive and interesting contests are going to be organized as well. Contests such as Debate and elocution on women empowerment, quiz, best business plan idea to encourage women entrepreneurs, caption writing contest for women empowerment, storytelling #our story where a woman can share her story which can be an inspiration for millions of others. 
        These contests can also bring about a change as debate and elocution on women empowerment will bring about valid, empowering, factual information in front of you. A debate consists of points that are capable of making your mind shift towards the best argument and if you are a good listener and can refine the statements. Debates can bring about a significant impact on your life step in a beautiful direction. 
        And a debate not only impacts the listeners, it creates an impact on the mind of debaters as well because the counter points can affect how they think, perceive and process. Because there will not be baseless arguments, they will support their arguments with strong justifying points which, would help people choose the right path to follow. 
        A quiz can be useful as well because quizzes will be based on women empowerment and quiz will have facts and if people are aware of the facts there will discretion for them for the course of action they are going to follow in the future. A quiz is always informative and people who are always seeking information regarding women empowerment will have a lot to gather and make wise decision further. 
        And the contest to find the best business plan idea to encourage women entrepreneurs will showcase various business plans that women are looking for start-ups and business ventures can learn from here and can apply them. A business can make a women independent and she can look after herself without some else’s help. Being independent is one of the biggest aspects of women’s empowerment as independence gives freedom, voice, power, decision making knowledge and an identity of her own. 
        Big names such as Anisha Singh (mydaala.com), Ekta Kapoor (Balaji telefilms), Indira Noori (CEO of Pepsi co.), Chanda Kochar (Ex CEO of ICICI Bank) are an inspiration for millions of women out there. Women aspire to be like them and to get independence with which can have voice and the opportunity to prove them. 
        And there is also storytelling #our story where a woman can share her story which can be an inspiration for millions of others. Stories inspire lot many women to take first step towards a better life for them. Women have always been living in fear, fear of the patriarchal norms and when they see other women coming out of that fear they also try to imitate them or teach their daughters to be like those fearless women. 
        The Jhansi of Rani has been a classic and most empowering example that each women make their daughter’s familiar with her. She was fearless, strong and most importantly as women who fought fearlessly. Every mother wants her daughter to be like her. They want their daughter’s to fight for them and not sit quietly and suffer from the societal norms and patriarchy. Each women look forward for a change bearer and a better world to live in. 
        This conference will bring about a change in people’s lives because information, knowledge, experience, real life stories and facts can do wonders with the brain of people. There is a lot to learn and a lot of people to learn from. Real life heroes can really inspire people to follow their path and their path will be difficult but, they will also give people courage and confidence to choose that path. 
        Every difficult thing is not impossible but, the end result is always beautiful. If you want to gather courage, confidence and knowledge this is the right place for you.
